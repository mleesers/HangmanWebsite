# HangmanWebsite

This is a personal project i did to refresh myself on JavaScript and CSS. 
It is simple Hangman game with 3 choices meant to be like my python hangman game linked here,(https://github.com/mleesers/hangman), but with a UI.
It features local cache so that it remembers what your win loss is from your precious session. It keeps track of all letters used and shows a winning or losing page when you win or lose.
